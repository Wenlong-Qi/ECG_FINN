STITCHED_IP
=====
The Stitched_IP was generated by FINN compiler, and the target FPGA was set to Kintex7 xc7k70tfbg484-1.
If the Stitched_IP doesn't support your FPGA, please open the component.xml file of each IP package and add your FPGA Family, e.g. Spartan7.

This directory contains all IP Packages for ECG, an ECG_IP as top Ip core and other 22 subcore as subIP in stitched IP. 
All of them should be added in IP Repositories(Tools->Settings->IP->Repository).

1. Create a Block Design and add IP finn_design_v1_0, then make externals for the interface. Make sure all the frequenz are set to 50MHz.
2. Create HDL Wrapper for the block design.
3. Add simulation file(testbench.v). Modify the dataset path for simulation. 
4. Run Simulation to check if the stitched_ip works well.
